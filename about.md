I am Stefanos Michael and I was born in a small town in Cyprus, called Paralimni. I am currently studying Electrical & Computer Engineering at University of Patras, Greece. I know a bunch of programming languages and I use designing tools like a boss.
At the moment I am working with George Lydakis, a friend of mine, on Collaborative Robotics and specifically on Collaborative Localization using a Visual Inertia Navigation System (V-INS). You can read more on the dissertation log.

That's all folks, for now!
